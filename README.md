# Title:
Booklens (TBD)
# Description:
A webapp that could be used for finding books that people find interesting.
So people would point their phone at their bookshelf, the camera would get the names of the books (using text recognition), look them up, find their characteristics (like genre and age range), and then use a model to find other books that people would be interested in based on the books that they have.

This dataset has information about many different books and ratings on those books from different people. Crucially it shows who rated what books what ratings. This allows me to make inferences that if someone likes a few particular books, they will probably like some certain other ones.
