# Title:
Booklens (TBD)
# Description:
A webapp that could be used for finding books that people find interesting. So people would upload photos of their bookshelf, and the app would then find the names of the books (using text recognition) look them up, and then use a model to determine that other books that people would be interested in based on the books that they have. It would then redirect them to a page with a list of those books, as while as some other data, such as the book covers.

This dataset has information about many different books and ratings on those books from different people. Crucially it shows who rated what books what ratings. This allows me to make inferences that if someone likes a few particular books, they will probably like some certain other ones.
